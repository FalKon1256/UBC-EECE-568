# UBC-EECE 568 - From Exploring to Building Machine Learning Models

## Semester
2023 Winter Session Term 1

## Outline
This course covers a variety of machine learning algorithms and models, while I learned the fundamentals through practical implementation of prediction or classification tasks. We selected speech emotion detection (SER) as the topic of our final project while developing a CNN-LSTM to reach a final accuracy of 62%.

Assignment 2: <br />
• Image Classification using CNNs <br />
• Anomaly Detection using CNNs <br />
• Sentiment Analysis using RNNs <br />

Assignment 3: <br />
