# UBC-EECE 568 - From Exploring to Building Machine Learning Models

## Semester
2023 Winter Session Term 1

## Outline
This course covers a variety of machine learning algorithms and models, while I learned the fundamentals through practical implementation of prediction or classification tasks. We selected speech emotion detection (SER) as the topic of our final project while developing a CNN-LSTM to reach a final accuracy of 62%.

Assignment 1:
• Regression <br />
• Principal Component Analysis (PCA) <br />
• K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) <br />

Assignment 2: CNN, RNN
• Image Classification using CNNs <br />
• Anomaly Detection using CNNs <br />
• Sentiment Analysis using RNNs <br />

Assignment 3: Transformers, ViT
• Text Classification using Transformers <br />
• Image Classification using ViT <br />
• Multi-Task ViT <br />

## Tools
• Google Colab (Python)
